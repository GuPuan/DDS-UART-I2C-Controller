# DDS UART-I2C Controller
 This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a controller module for a Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS). The module interfaces with UART and I2C peripherals, enabling users to configure DDS parameters such as waveform type, frequency, and phase via commands received over UART. The I2C interface allows storing and retrieving these configurations in an EEPROM.
